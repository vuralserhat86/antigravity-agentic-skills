Quick question about [their company]'s [specific challenge]
```

```
[Quantifiable outcome] for [their company type]
```

**Version C** (Personalized):
```
[Name], saw your post about [specific topic]
```

**Recommended**: Test A vs B initially, use C for highly personalized segments

---

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their company/role/recent activity] and thought you might be facing [specific challenge common to their situation].

We've helped [similar company 1] and [similar company 2] [achieve specific outcome] without [common objection/pain point].

Worth a quick 15-minute conversation to see if we can do the same for [their company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Company]

P.S. - [Personalized one-liner based on research - optional but powerful]
```

### Variables to Customize

| Variable | Example | How to Find |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `[specific observation]` | "you're expanding to 3 new regions" | LinkedIn, company news, press releases |
| `[specific challenge]` | "managing distributed team security" | Job postings, industry reports, LinkedIn posts |
| `[similar company 1]` | "Acme Corp (Series B, 50 employees)" | Your customer list, same industry/stage |

### Personalization Examples

>
> Worth a quick call to see if we could help Acme do the same?

**Enterprise**:
> Hi John,
>
> Noticed your team at GlobalTech recently posted 8 cloud security engineer roles. When my previous clients scaled that fast, credential management became a nightmare.
>
> We've helped Fortune 500 IT teams like yours at Cisco and IBM automate access controls—cutting security incidents by 75%.
>
> 15 minutes to discuss your approach?

I'm going to assume [topic] isn't a priority right now, and that's totally fine.

I'll close your file on my end unless I hear otherwise.

- Question vs. Statement
- Generic vs. Personalized
- Short (3-5 words) vs. Long (8-12 words)
- Curiosity vs. Value prop
- With emoji vs. without

**Email Body**:
- Length: Short (50 words) vs. Medium (100 words)
- CTA: Link vs. Question vs. Time slot

- Social proof: Stats vs. Names vs. Quotes

**Sending Time**:
- Morning (9-11 AM) vs. Afternoon (2-4 PM)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **The 3-Second Rule**: Prospect should understand value in first 3 seconds of reading
2. **One CTA Only**: Don't give multiple options; one clear next step
3. **Mobile-First**: 50%+ of emails opened on mobile; keep it scannable
4. **No Attachments**: Use links instead; attachments trigger spam filters
5. **Real Reply-To**: Use your actual email, not no-reply@ (and actually reply!)
6. **Personalization Tokens**: Use sparingly; obvious automation kills trust
7. **The P.S. Works**: PostScripts get read; use for secondary CTA
8. **Remove Unsubscribes**: No formal unsubscribe needed for 1-to-1 prospecting

### What to Avoid

**Spam Trigger Words**:
- "Free", "Limited time", "Act now"
- "$$$$", "Make money"
- ALL CAPS anything
- Too many exclamation points!!!

**Design No-Nos**:
- Images (especially logos)
- HTML-heavy templates
- Multiple font colors/sizes
- Long links (use link shorteners)

> **Kaynak:** [Salesloft Deliverability & Outreach Standards](https://salesloft.com/resources/blog/email-deliverability-guide/) & [Lemlist Cold Email Guide 2025](https://www.lemlist.com/blog/cold-email-guide)

### Aşama 1: Infrastructure & Warm-up (The "Foundation")
- [ ] **Technical Setup**: SPF, DKIM ve DMARC kayıtlarını doğrula. Özel takip domaini (Custom Tracking Domain) kur.
- [ ] **Warm-up**: Yeni inbox'ı en az 3-4 hafta otomatik araçlarla ısıt (Daily volume limit: 20-30).
- [ ] **Verification**: Liste temizliğini yap (NeverBounce/ZeroBounce). Bounce rate'i %2'nin altında tut.

### Aşama 2: Strategic Personalization & AI (The "Message")
- [ ] **AI First Line**: Her prospect için sadece isim değil, LinkedIn veya son haberlerine dayalı 1-to-1 açılış cümlesi üret.
- [ ] **Value Prop**: "Biz ne yapıyoruz" değil, "Onların hangi sorununu çözüyoruz" odaklı metin yaz.
- [ ] **A/B Testing**: Subject line ve CTA (Call to Action) için varyasyonlar oluştur.

### Aşama 3: Multi-Touch Sequence & Deliverability (The "Cadence")
- [ ] **Multi-Channel**: Sadece email değil, LinkedIn ziyareti ve mesajı ile destekle (Omnichannel).
- [ ] **Spacing**: Takip mesajları arasına 2-3 gün boşluk bırak. 7-12 adımdan oluşan bir sekans kur.
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Open rate %50+ ve Reply rate %5+ hedeflerini takip et.

### Kontrol Noktaları
| Aşama | Doğrulama |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Spam trigger kelimeler ("Free", "Money", "Act Now") temizlendi mi? |
| 2 | Her email mobil cihazda tek ekranda okunabiliyor mu? |
| 3 | Sequence içinde bir "Break-up" email'i mevcut mu? |
