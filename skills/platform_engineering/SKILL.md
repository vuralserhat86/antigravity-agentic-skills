# Platform Engineering

## Purpose

Build Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that provide self-service infrastructure, reduce cognitive load, and accelerate developer productivity through golden paths and platform-as-product thinking.

Platform engineering represents the evolution beyond traditional DevOps, focusing on creating product-quality internal platforms that treat developers as customers. The discipline addresses the developer productivity crisis where engineers spend 30-40% of time on infrastructure and tooling instead of features.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- Building or improving an internal developer platform
- Designing a developer portal (Backstage, Port, or commercial IDP)
- Implementing golden paths and software templates
- Establishing or restructuring a platform engineering team
- Measuring and improving developer experience (DevEx)
- Integrating IDP with infrastructure, CI/CD, observability, or security tools
- Driving platform adoption across an engineering organization
- Assessing platform maturity and identifying capability gaps

## Core Concepts

### Platform as Product

Treat internal platforms with the same rigor as customer-facing products:

**Product Management Approach:**
- Define platform vision, strategy, and roadmap
- Identify developer "customers" and their pain points
- Measure success via adoption metrics, satisfaction surveys, and business impact
- Iterate based on feedback loops and usage analytics
- Balance new capabilities with platform reliability and support

**Key Differences from Traditional DevOps:**
- DevOps focuses on delivery pipelines; platform engineering builds comprehensive developer experiences
- Platform teams operate as product teams (product managers, UX designers, engineers)
- Success measured by developer productivity and satisfaction, not just infrastructure metrics
- Self-service is the primary interface, not ticket queues

### Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Architecture

**Three-Layer Architecture:**

**1. Developer Portal (Frontend)**
- Service catalog: Inventory of services with ownership, dependencies, health status
- Software templates: Project scaffolding with best practices baked in
- Documentation hub: Centralized, searchable, version-controlled docs
- Self-service workflows: Environment provisioning, deployments, access requests

**2. Platform Orchestration (Backend)**
- Infrastructure provisioning: Multi-cloud resource management
- Environment management: Dev, staging, production lifecycle
- Deployment automation: GitOps-based continuous delivery
- Configuration management: Separation of app and infrastructure concerns

**3. Integration Layer (Glue)**
- CI/CD integration: Pipeline visibility and triggering
- Observability: Metrics, logs, traces surfaced in portal
- Security: Vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement, secrets management
- FinOps: Cost visibility, budgets, optimization recommendations

For detailed architecture patterns and component breakdowns, see `references/idp-architecture.md`.

### Golden Paths and Scaffolding

**Golden Path Principle:**
Provide opinionated templates that handle 80% of use cases while allowing escape hatches for the remaining 20%.

**Template Components:**
- Repository structure and boilerplate code
- Infrastructure as code (Kubernetes manifests, Terraform)
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Observability instrumentation (metrics, logging, tracing)
- Security configurations (RBAC, network policies, secrets)
- Documentation templates (README, runbooks, architecture diagrams)

**Constraint Mechanisms:**
- Policy-as-code enforcement (OPA, Kyverno) for security and compliance
- Resource limits and quotas to prevent over-provisioning
- Required health checks and observability instrumentation
- Approved base images and dependency scanning

For template design patterns and examples, see `references/golden-paths.md`.

### Developer Experience (DevEx) Optimization

**Cognitive Load Reduction:**
- Abstract infrastructure complexity without hiding necessary details
- Provide sensible defaults with clear override mechanisms
- Use progressive disclosure (simple for common cases, advanced options available)
- Consolidate tooling (single developer portal vs. 15+ separate tools)

**Key Metrics:**

**DORA Metrics:**
- Deployment frequency (how often code reaches production)
- Lead time for changes (commit to production duration)
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR for incidents)
- Change failure rate (percentage of deployments causing incidents)

**SPACE Framework:**
- Satisfaction: Developer happiness via surveys and NPS
- Performance: Throughput and efficiency of work completed
- Activity: Code commits, PRs, deployments (context, not raw counts)
- Communication: Collaboration quality, discoverability
- Efficiency: Minimize interruptions, reduce toil

**Platform-Specific Metrics:**
- Platform adoption rate (percentage of teams using platform)
- Self-service rate (actions completed without platform team tickets)
- Onboarding time (new developer to first production deployment)
- Template usage (which golden paths are adopted)
- Support ticket volume and resolution time

## Platform Maturity Assessment

Assess current platform capabilities using a 5-level maturity model:

**Level 0: Ad-Hoc** - Manual provisioning, no standardization
**Level 1: Basic Automation** - Some IaC and CI/CD, limited self-service
**Level 2: Paved Paths** - Golden path templates, early portal, limited coverage
**Level 3: Self-Service Platform** - Comprehensive portal, 80%+ self-service
**Level 4: Product-Driven Platform** - Data-driven, product team structure, FinOps integration
**Level 5: AI-Augmented Platform** - AI-assisted troubleshooting, predictive optimization

For detailed assessment framework, gap analysis, and improvement roadmap, see `references/maturity-model.md`.

## Decision Frameworks

### Build vs. Buy IDP

**Choose Open Source (Backstage) when:**
- Large enterprise (1000+ engineers)
- Dedicated platform team available (5-10 engineers)
- Deep customization required
- Open-source ecosystem preferred
- Long-term investment (3+ year horizon)

**Choose Commercial IDP (Port, Humanitec, Cortex) when:**
- Mid-size organization (100-1000 engineers)
- Faster time-to-value needed (3-6 months vs. 6-12 months)
- Prefer managed solution with vendor support
- Limited platform engineering resources (<5 engineers)
- Standard use cases (web apps, microservices, CI/CD)

**Choose Hybrid Approach when:**
- Large organization needing both flexibility and speed
- Complex infrastructure requiring orchestration backend
- Want best-in-class portal + orchestration components
- Willing to integrate multiple systems (e.g., Backstage + Humanitec)

For complete decision tree, selection criteria, and ROI calculations, see `references/decision-frameworks.md`.

### Golden Path Design: Flexibility vs. Standardization

**Spectrum of Control:**

**High Standardization (Regulated Industries):**
- Limited technology choices, mandatory templates
- Policy enforcement via admission controllers (OPA, Kyverno)
- Escape hatches require approval process

**Balanced Approach (Recommended for Most):**
- Recommended golden paths (easy, well-documented, supported)
- Alternatives allowed with documentation
- Soft enforcement (defaults + education, not hard blocks)
- Clear ownership for deviations ("deviate and own")

**High Flexibility (Innovative Organizations):**
- Golden paths as suggestions (not requirements)
- Minimal policy enforcement (only critical security)
- "Build it, run it" ownership model

For detailed guidance on choosing the right balance and enforcement strategies, see `references/decision-frameworks.md`.

### Platform Team Structure

**Centralized Model:**
- Single platform team (5-20 engineers) serving entire organization
- Best for: Small to mid-size orgs (100-500 engineers)

**Federated Model:**
- Central team (5-10 engineers) + embedded engineers (1-2 per business unit)
- Best for: Large orgs (500-2000+ engineers), multiple business units

**Hub-and-Spoke Model:**
- Central "hub" team (3-5 engineers) + "spoke" teams contributing plugins
- Best for: Organizations with strong open-source culture

For team sizing, roles, responsibilities, and governance models, see `references/decision-frameworks.md`.

## Implementation Guides

### Bootstrapping a Platform

**Foundation Phase (Months 1-3):**
1. Define platform vision and form platform team (3-5 members)
2. Interview developers to identify pain points
3. Set up developer portal (Backstage or commercial)
4. Create initial service catalog and first golden path template

**Pilot Phase (Months 4-6):**
1. Select 2-3 pilot teams for white-glove onboarding
2. Rapid iteration based on feedback
3. Expand to 3-5 golden path templates
4. Integrate key tools (CI/CD, monitoring, secrets)

**Expansion Phase (Months 7-12):**
1. Scale to 20-50% of engineering teams
2. Build self-service documentation and training
3. Establish platform SLOs and on-call rotation
4. Internal evangelization (demos, champions program)

**Maturity Phase (Year 2+):**
1. 80%+ adoption across organization
2. Platform team operates as product team
3. Continuous improvement via metrics and feedback
4. AI-assisted capabilities, policy-as-code expansion

For detailed implementation steps and bootstrapping code, see `references/implementation-backstage.md`.

### Creating Golden Path Templates

**Template Design Process:**
1. Identify most common use case (web app, API, data pipeline)
2. Define opinionated choices (language, framework, deployment pattern)
3. Create repository structure and infrastructure manifests
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
5. Instrument observability and document usage
6. Test with pilot team before broad rollout

**Template Categories:**
- Full-stack web application (backend API + frontend + database)
- Data pipeline (ETL/ELT with orchestration)
- Machine learning service (model serving, monitoring)
- Event-driven microservice (message broker integration)
- Scheduled job (cron jobs, batch processing)

For template examples, scaffolding code, and customization patterns, see `references/golden-paths.md` and `examples/` directory.

### Driving Platform Adoption

**Evangelization Strategies:**
- Showcase pilot team successes (internal blog posts, demos)
- Lunch-and-learns on platform capabilities
- Internal champions program (power users helping peers)
- Office hours and Slack/Teams support channels

**Incentive Alignment:**
- Make platform easier than alternatives (golden paths are "paved roads")
- Integrate with workflows developers already use
- Provide immediate value (faster onboarding, better visibility)
- Celebrate early adopters, showcase their successes

For adoption metrics, tracking dashboards, and success patterns, see `references/maturity-model.md`.

## 🔄 Workflow

> **Kaynak:** [Platform Engineering Community](https://platformengineering.org/) & [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)

### Aşama 1: Discovery & Strategy (Product Mindset)
- [ ] **User Research**: Geliştiricilerin en büyük acı noktalarını belirle (Örn: Env provisioning çok yavaş).
- [ ] **TVP (Thinnest Viable Platform)**: Her şeyi otomatize etme. Önce bir "Golden Path" (Örn: Spring Boot on K8s) seç.
- [ ] **Capabilities**: Portal (Backstage/Port) mi yoksa sadece CLI mı? İhtiyaca göre karar ver.

### Aşama 2: Implementation (Golden Paths)
- [ ] **Template**: `cookiecutter` veya Backstage Scaffolder ile proje şablonu oluştur.
- [ ] **Orchestration**: Infrastructure (Terraform/Crossplane) ile App Config'i ayır (Score/Workload spec).
- [ ] **Portal**: Servis kataloğunu ve dokümantasyonu merkezi bir portale bağla.

### Aşama 3: Adoption & Evolution
- [ ] **Marketing**: Platformu ürün gibi pazarla (Internal Demos, Newsletters).
- [ ] **Metrics**: DORA ve SPACE metriklerini ölç. Platform adoption rate'i takip et.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Geliştiricilerden düzenli geri bildirim al ve roadmap'i güncelle.

### Kontrol Noktaları
| Aşama | Doğrulama |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Platform ekibi geliştiricilerin işine "engel" mi yoksa "hızlandırıcı" mı? |
| 2 | "Cognitive Load" azaldı mı? (Geliştirici Kubernetes YAML yazmak zorunda mı?) |
| 3 | Dokümantasyon "Self-service" olmaya yeterli mi? |
